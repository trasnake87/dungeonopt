(node:2723858) [MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON] Warning: Module type of file:///home/thomasrasnake/dung/test-variance-simple.js is not specified and it doesn't parse as CommonJS.
Reparsing as ES module because module syntax was detected. This incurs a performance overhead.
To eliminate this warning, add "type": "module" to /home/thomasrasnake/dung/package.json.
(Use `node --trace-warnings ...` to show where the warning was created)

INTERPRETATION
======================================================================
If we're comparing two allocations, we'd want the difference to be
at least 0.000% (2x std dev) to be confident it's real.
